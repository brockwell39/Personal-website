              <p>Upon graduation Alex decided to start his own business.
              He started a location catering company called Oranges Location Catering. Which provides catering for film crews.</p>

              <p>He started by helping out his friend on his graduate short film down in bournemouth.
              Where he cooked breakfast and lunch for 30 students for a week. He quite enjoyed this so
              decided to see how far he could take it.</p>

              <P>Alex started by renting a small catering trailer and pitching to music video producers,
              because this is very price sensitive market he was able to undercut the competition.</p>

              <P>Slowly he managed to build up a list of contacts and turnover grew,
              he bought his own catering trailer on a lease deal and took on a member of staff.</p>

              <p>After a few years he decided to take on a chef who would take on the cooking responsibilities
              and Alex could concentrate on the running of the business.</p>

              <p>He invested in new equipment and took out a lease on a light industrial unit in Brixton.
              Turnover again grew. Below is a table of the turnover over the years
              and shows how he has managed to grow the turnover.</p>

              <p>After 7 years Alex decided he has had enough of the catering ,
              the early starts were getting too much for him so he decided to lean <a href="coding.html">coding</a>.</p>
